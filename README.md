# gatsbyjs-devcontainer
VSCode .devcontainer files to use with Docker Hub [Gatsbyjs devcontainer](https://hub.docker.com/r/edpike365/gatsbyjs-devcontainer) images.

Each version of the Docker image has a required `devcontainer.js` and `Dockerfile`. Each version also has the Dockerfile that was used to build the Docker hub image. The file is name `Dockerfile:tag` to prevent name collision.

Each version has its own folder.
